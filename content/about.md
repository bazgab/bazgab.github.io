### A little about me

My name is Gabriel Bazzotti and this is my personal blog. In here you can hope to find musings about open-source software development, distributed systems, build tools, CI pipelines, among other things.

I'm a Site Reliability Engineer at SUSE, and occasionally a speaker at tech conferences. A full list of talks can be found below, however there are no guarantees to be videos at any of them, unfortunately. The easiest way you can reach out to me is at my e-mail `gabriel.bazzotti@suse.com`, but I also hope to answer messages on GitHub.

Thank you for the attention so far, and let's build something together :)
